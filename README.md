# st2195_assignment_3
This assignment is to learn how to use *SQLite Database*

**Therefore in this assignment i was asked to:**
> *Create a GitHub repository called “st2195_assignment31” that includes:*
>> *1. a README.md file with a short markdown description of this assignment and a reference to the Data Expo 2009 data, and the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7)*
>> *2. a folder called “r_sql” with a R code for constructing the database (from the csv inputs) and replicating the queries in the practice quiz. The latter should be done both using DBI and dplyr notation*
>> *3. a folder called “python_sql” with a Python version of the code in point 2, based on sqlite3*
>> *4. A simplified solution for the query in Q4 in either R or Python (placed either in the R or Python *_sql folder)*


**Doubts and Issues:**  
1. sql is not case sensitive? when using DBI can i use lower case? with dyplr I know i cant
2. i don't understand question 4 from the exercise
3. in question 5, because it needs to be a flot, i found it easier to just multiply by 1.0 to force it, insted on changing the variables to floats. That always works, or are there situations where it is better to change to float
4. the enconding of 2001 and 2002 is different, and i could not find the right one to use (not even on notepad++) so there might be wrong answers
5. I assumed that we were still looking for the same options from the practice exercise in all the question
