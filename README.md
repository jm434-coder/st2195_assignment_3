# st2195_assignment_3
This assignment is to learn how to use *SQLite Database*

**Therefore in this assignment i was asked to:**
> *Create a GitHub repository called “st2195_assignment31” that includes:*
>> *1. a README.md file with a short markdown description of this assignment and a reference to the Data Expo 2009 data, and the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7)*
>> *2. a folder called “r_sql” with a R code for constructing the database (from the csv inputs) and replicating the queries in the practice quiz. The latter should be done both using DBI and dplyr notation*
>> *3. a folder called “python_sql” with a Python version of the code in point 2, based on sqlite3*
>> *4. A simplified solution for the query in Q4 in either R or Python (placed either in the R or Python *_sql folder)*
